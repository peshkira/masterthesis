\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

%I thank my supervisor, Prof. Andreas Rauber, for many insightful and inspirational conversations, the helpful comments and constructive suggestions that made this thesis possible. 
%
%I also would like to thank my other supervisor and reviewer, Dr. Christoph Becker, for his guidance, technical support and suggestions during the development of this document. Without him, the work presented here would have never been a part of the SCAPE project and I probably wouldn't have written it, as he inspired me to do so. I thank him for all those critical but constructive reviews and talks, that sometimes made my life seem hard but whithout which this thesis wouldn't be.
%
%I thank, Bjarne Andersson,  for providing the test data, that made all the experiments possible. Without it, this would have not been possible.

%Last but not least, I would like to thank my family. They have always been there for me. My sister, Amada Petrova, has always been a model for me. She has always provided me with a good example and helped me financially and morally. 
%My mother, Evgenia Petrova, has been an inspiration throughout my whole life and has always supported my dreams and desires. I'd like to thank her for all she has done for me.
