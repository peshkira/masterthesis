%\section{General Information}
%
%This document is intended as a template and guideline and should support the author in the course of doing the master's thesis.
%Assessment criteria comprise the quality of the theoretical and/or practical work as well as structure, content and wording of the written master's thesis. Careful attention should be given to the basics of scientific work (e.g., correct citation).
%
%\section{Organizational Issues}
%
%A master's thesis at the Faculty of Informatics has to be finished within six months. During this period regular meetings between the advisor(s) and the author have to take place.
%In addition, the following milestones have to be fulfilled:
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item  Within one month after having fixed the topic of the thesis the master's thesis proposal has to be prepared and must be accepted by the advisor(s). The master's thesis proposal must follow the respective template of the dean of academic affairs. Thereafter the proposal has to be applied for at the deanery. The necessary forms may be found on the web site of the Faculty of Informatics. \url{http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/dekanat/formulare.html}
%  \item  Accompanied with the master's thesis proposal, the structure of the thesis in terms of a table of contents has to be provided.
%  \item Then, the first talk has to be given at the so-called ``Seminar for Master Students''. The slides have to be discussed with the advisor(s) one week in advance. Attendance of the ``Seminar for Master Students'' is compulsory and offers the opportunity to discuss arising problems among other master students.
%  \item At the latest five months after the beginning, a provisional final version of the thesis has to be handed over to the advisor(s).  
%  \item As soon as the provisional final version exists, a first poster draft has to be made. The making of a poster is a compulsory part of the ``Seminar for Master Students'' for all master studies at the Faculty of Informatics. Drafts and design guidelines can be found at \url{http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/studium/richtlinien}.
%  \item After having consulted the advisor(s) the second talk has to be held at the ``Seminar for Master Students''.
%  \item At the latest six months after the beginning, the corrected version of the master's thesis and the poster have to be handed over to the advisor(s).
%  \item After completion the master's thesis has to be presented at the ``epilog''. For detailed information on the epilog see: \\ \url{http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/studium/epilog}
%\end{enumerate}

%\section{Structure of the Master's Thesis}
%
%If the curriculum regulates the language of the master's thesis to be English (like for ``Business Informatics''), the thesis has to be written in English. Otherwise, the master's thesis may be written in English or in German. The structure of the thesis is predetermined.
%The table of contents is followed by the introduction and the main part, which can vary according to the content. The master's thesis ends with the bibliography (compulsory) and the appendix (optional).

\section{Introduction}
Information Technology enables us to write our thoughts and ideas down, to capture moments of our lives in videos and photos, to listen to our favorite songs and so much more in an easy fashion. It completely changed the way of how we think about content. And as it becomes easier and cheaper to create, edit, manipulate, store and share large amounts of digital objects, users often grow unaware of the problems that arise with the digital content they create.

A single sheet of paper put in a normal environment can easiliy endure a number of decades and will still be readable and accessible. A digital object, a file that contains the same content, often doesn't stand a chance of living through the next decade. Hardware failures, software obscolescence, changed environment, lack of backup copies are just a small set of examples of what may occur to your digital objects and render you unable to access your content again.

Digital Preservation is aiming to preserve digital content through the years and make it accessible, readable and understandable for longer periods of time. In the last years growing awareness of digital preservation problems is seen throughout scientific communities, memory institutions and business enterpires. These create solutions and apply different preservation actions on content in order to tackle many problems on different levels.

%explain a bit about preservation planning and make a flow to the motivation
\section{Motivation}
% talk more about preservation planning
% why is it important, the steps in consists of
% automation and its importance.
% concetrate on collection profiling
% why is it important to know what do we have
% in the collections.
\section{Problem Statement}
Very often collection and content profiling is done on a very higher level, that
is often insufficient for a planning process, especially if this process is to be automated.
The current state of the art is collecting simple metrics, such as collection size, and number of elements as well as the formats present in the collection. These measurements are important but are not the only ones needed for the creation of an efficient preservation plan.
In order to create a plan a small subset of the collection is needed in order to conduct some experiments. Based on the results, recommendations and decisions about the preservation actions of the whole collection is needed. Thus the choosing of a representative collection subset is a very important process, that is unfortunately often taken lightly.
